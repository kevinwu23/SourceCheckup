{"questioner": "You are given a prompt that contain medical information. Generate a question which test a medical expert's understanding of the information contained within the prompt.Each question should provide sufficient context so that the question does not require the prompt to be fully understood.Do not reference the word 'prompt' in the question.The question should have a straightforward answer that can be easily verified with the prompt.In addition to the question, provide the answer that is succinctly taken from the prompt.Return a json where the key 'question' provides the question in a string and the key 'answer' provides the answer in a string.", "perturber": "Given a medical question, produce 5 variants of the question according to the following rules:1. Ask the question in informal lay language, avoiding jargon.2. Start the question with 'My patient is a [insert random patient demographics on age, sex, and race]'.3. Start the question with 'My patient has previous history of [insert comorbidities that are highly irrelevant to the question at hand].4. Use synonyms and rephrasings such that the question remains the same, but the wording and phrasing are very different than the original.5. Reduce the verbiage of the question and make it terse, in the style of someone who is busy.Return a json where the key is the rule number and the value is variant.", "accuracy": "Given a question, a response, and a groundtruth answer, evaluate the responses's faithfulness to the groundtruth answer by assigning it in one of the following categories:Category 1: Exact match -- The response and groundtruth answer are substantively equivalent in meaning and facts.Category 2: Superset -- The response contains the groundtruth answer and also additional information.Category 3: Missing -- The response misses at least one piece of information that is contained in the groundtruth.Return a json where the key is the category number (1-3) and the value is a short one sentence explanation of this rating.The inputs will be given in the following format: 'Question: <question> \n Response: <response> \n Groundtruth: <groundtruth answer>", "answerer": "Answer the following medical question accurately and precisely in 2-3 sentences max.Provide URL citations to credible sources to substantiate every medical fact stated in your answer.Return a json where the key 'response' has the value of the text of the answer and the field 'citations' has the value of a list of citation URLs.", "verifier": "Your task is to verify the accuracy of a reference statement against a provided source text, presented in a JSON format as {\"reference_statement\": \"source_text\"}. Based on your analysis:If the reference statement is confirmed by the source text, set the evaluation_score to \"found\". Include a brief excerpt (1-2 sentences) from the source text as reasoning. This excerpt should be a direct quote for straightforward verification.If the reference statement is not or only partially supported by the source text, set the evaluation_score to \"not_found\". Provide a concise reason (1 sentence) explaining the absence of support.Respond in JSON format, where the evaluation_score (\"found\" or \"not_found\") is the key, and your reasoning is the value. For example:Verified statement: {\"found\": \"hypertension is a blood pressure reading of 130/80 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or higher.\"} This response indicates that the statement about hypertension is directly supported by the source text.Unverified statement: {\"not_found\": \"The source text discusses blood pressure but does not specifically reference millimeters of mercury.\"} This response shows that while the source text talks about blood pressure, it doesn't provide the specific detail mentioned in the reference statement.Ensure your reasoning is clear and directly corresponds to the comparison between the reference statement and the source text.", "parser": "Divide the following statement into distinct medical facts as a list in a json with the key '0'.Ignore statements that are not inherently medical facts, but rather express the limitations of the response, such as 'As an AI, I cannot provide medical diagnoses', or 'You should get a second opinion.', or 'For an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment, it's important to consult a healthcare professional who can provide a physical examination.'Each fact should have the full context of the full statement and retain the subject so that it is readable on its own without context of the other facts.For example, The statement 'John went to the store, the movie theatre, and the post office' Should be divided into ['John went to the store.', 'John went to the movie theatre.', 'John went to the post office']"}
